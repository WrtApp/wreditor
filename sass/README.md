# Fraction.sass!

Fraction.sass is Fraction.less' new SASS support. Support is currently __experimental__!

This has not been thoroughly tested. Please submit any bugs as issues [on GitHub](https://github.com/billpatrianakos/Fractionless-Boilerplate) or fork the project and submit a pull request. I'd be happy to include your SASS contributions.
