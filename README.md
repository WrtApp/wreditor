# Wreditor v1

Wreditor is the official editor used in Write.app as a standalone front-end.

## Project goals and philosophy

Make writing in the browser not suck. I believe that [browser based text editors should rival native counterparts](https://writeapp.me/writeapp/note/the-state-of-browser-based-text-editors). Wreditor should implement:

* Save on the fly (no page reloading, that's so 90's)
* Distraction-free view (focus on the writing, get the buttons out of the way)
* Live syntax highlighting
* Bracket completion
* Real tab indents
* Export to .txt, .md, .html, or .pdf
* Themes, color schemes, and other display options (font, font size, etc. but not too many)
* Must be a plain text editor (no formatting in the editor like TinyMCE, pure Markdown only but provide perfectly formatted output)
* Save text as UTF-8 always always always

## Usage

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/WrtApp/wreditor.git`
2. Connect the backend to whatever you want.
3. Open in a browser and enjoy!
